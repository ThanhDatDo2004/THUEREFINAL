## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Court Selection Component Integration

```tsx
// In BookingPage.tsx after time selection:
const data = await fetchAvailableQuantities(
  field.field_code,
  firstSlot.play_date,
  firstSlot.start_time,
  lastSlot.end_time
);

setAvailableQuantities(data.availableQuantities || []);

// Display component:
<AvailableCourtSelector
  availableQuantities={availableQuantities}
  selectedQuantityID={selectedQuantityID}
  onSelectCourt={setSelectedQuantityID}
  loading={loadingQuantities}
/>
```

### Booking Submission Update

```tsx
// quantityID now sent with booking:
const response = await confirmFieldBooking(field.field_code, {
  slots: selectedSlots.map(slot => ({...})),
  payment_method: formData.payment_method,
  total_price: effectiveBooking.totalPrice,
  customer: {
    name: formData.customer_name,
    email: formData.customer_email,
    phone: formData.customer_phone,
  },
  quantityID: selectedQuantityID,  // ← NEW!
  notes: formData.notes,
});
```

### Data Flow

```
User selects time → fetchAvailableQuantities API call
                  → Get available courts list
                  → Display AvailableCourtSelector
                  → User selects court
                  → Store selectedQuantityID
                  → Send with booking submission
                  → Backend saves quantityID
                  → Display in confirmation & history
