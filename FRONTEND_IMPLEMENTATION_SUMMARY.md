### KIỂM TRA 2: Thông tin người đặt từ STEP 2 ✅ WORKING

**Form Fields in BookingPage (Step 2):**
```typescript
customer_name: string;        ✅ Name of booker
customer_email: string;       ✅ Email of booker
customer_phone: string;       ✅ Phone of booker
payment_method: "banktransfer"; ✅ Payment method
notes?: string;               ✅ Optional notes
```

**Payload Sent:**
```typescript
confirmFieldBooking(field.field_code, {
  slots: [...],                    // Selected time slots
  payment_method: "banktransfer",  // Payment method
  total_price: 300000,             // Total amount
  customer: {
    name: "Nguyễn Văn A",         ✅ SENT
    email: "a@example.com",        ✅ SENT
    phone: "0912345678"            ✅ SENT
  },
  notes: "..."                    // Optional notes
})
```

**API Endpoint Called:**
- `POST /api/fields/:fieldCode/bookings/confirm`

**Status:** ✅ Frontend correctly sends all customer information. Backend must receive and save these 3 fields.

### KIỂM TRA 3: Giờ đặt bị lock sớm ⚠️ BACKEND ACTION NEEDED

**Current Flow:**
```
1. User selects time on /booking/:id
   ↓
2. User fills Step 2 form with customer info
   ↓
3. Click "Xác nhận đặt sân" (Confirm Booking)
   ↓
4. Frontend calls: POST /api/fields/:fieldCode/bookings/confirm
   (Sends: slots, customer info, payment method)
   ↓
5. Response: ConfirmBookingResponse {
     booking_code: "BK-123ABC"
     qr_code, paymentID, amount, ...
   }
   ↓
6. Navigate to: /payment/:bookingCode/transfer
   ↓
7. User completes payment
   ↓
8. Redirect to: /payment/:bookingCode (Payment Result)
   ↓
9. User can see buttons to view booking or checkin code
```

**The Problem:**
- ⚠️ Backend calls `POST /api/fields/:fieldCode/bookings/confirm` immediately when user clicks "Xác nhận đặt sân"
- ❌ At this point, payment is NOT completed yet
- ❌ Backend may be LOCKING SLOTS immediately - THIS IS WRONG!
- ❌ User goes back to /booking/:id, and slots are unavailable (but never paid!)

**Desired Behavior:**
```
✅ User selects time → Slot is HELD for 15 minutes (not locked)
✅ User fills form + submits → Backend should still only HOLD slot
✅ Payment completes → LOCK slot permanently
✅ User goes back to /booking/:id → Previous slot remains AVAILABLE (if not paid)
```

**Required Backend Changes:**
1. When receiving `POST /api/fields/:fieldCode/bookings/confirm`:
   - ✅ Save customer info (name, email, phone) to database
   - ✅ Create booking with status "pending"
   - ✅ HOLD slots for 15 minutes (set hold_expires_at)
   - ❌ DO NOT LOCK slots yet

2. When payment verification completes:
   - ✅ Update booking status to "confirmed"
   - ✅ LOCK slots permanently
   - ✅ Update payment_status to "paid"

3. When hold expires (after 15 minutes):
   - ✅ Release held slots
   - ✅ Cancel pending booking automatically

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Backend Team:
1. Ensure customer info (name, email, phone) is saved when receiving booking confirmation
2. Implement HOLD logic instead of immediate LOCK
3. Lock slots only after payment verification
4. Auto-release held slots after 15 minutes if unpaid

### For Testing:
1. Test navigation flow: Payment Result → Booking Detail → Checkin Code
2. Test error handling on all pages
3. Test loading states
4. Test mobile responsiveness
5. Verify customer info is displayed correctly
